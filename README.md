# Text_Sentiment_Test

This a test for the machine learning Text Sentiment Detection.
This is not the final result and only the first iteration.
This Design has a supervised learning algorithm for classification using one of these TextClassification datasets.
The Dataset is taken from the Pytorch repos./
This uses the ngram approach for the classification and could be made using bi-gram and tri-gram approaches also.
Testing using the aforementioned resources theoretically will give a better training split.
But Since the Loss Function of this was already low I have not Uploaded it yet.
The  results were as follows :- Loss: 0.0237(test)      |       Acc: 90.5%(test)
In the Future we will impliment this and try it again.
This repo can be forked after a mail to me and you are free to contribute to it.
