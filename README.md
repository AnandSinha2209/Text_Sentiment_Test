# Text_Sentiment_Test

1) This a test for the machine learning Text Sentiment Detection.
2) This is not the final result and only the first iteration.
3) This Design has a supervised learning algorithm for classification using one of these TextClassification datasets.
4) The Dataset is taken from the Pytorch repos.
5) This uses the ngram approach for the classification and could be made using bi-gram and tri-gram approaches also.
6) Testing using the aforementioned resources theoretically will give a better training split.
7) But Since the Loss Function of this was already low I have not Uploaded it yet.
8) The  results were as follows :- ""Loss: 0.0237(test)      |       Acc: 90.5%(test)""
9) In the Future we will impliment this and try it again.
10) This repo can be forked after a mail to me and you are free to contribute to it.
