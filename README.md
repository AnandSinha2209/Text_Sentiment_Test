# Text_Sentiment_Test

1) This a test for the machine learning Text Sentiment Detection.
2) This is not the final result and only the  ***first iteration***.
3) This Design has a supervised learning algorithm for classification using one of these TextClassification datasets.
4) The Dataset is taken from the Pytorch repos.
5) This uses the **ngram** approach for the classification and could be made using bi-gram and tri-gram approaches also.
6) Testing using the aforementioned resources theoretically will give a better training split.
7) But Since the Loss Function of this was already low I have not Uploaded it yet.
8) The  results were as follows :- **Loss: 0.0237(test)      |       Acc: 90.5%(test)**
9) In the Future we will impliment this and try it again.
10) This repo can be forked after a mail to me and you are free to contribute to it.


<h1>***Version 2***</h1>

Total Code Change along with a few more details and Calulations.

Used Binary Cross Entrol and Sigmoid Functions.

**Loss Function: 0.000**
